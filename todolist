1.wrap up the simulation(add Linear,average pooling), test it.
2.merge batchnorm with conv. (done)
3.do quantization of the model(relu6 to relu) (post training quantization, see the google paper,nvidia blog).
4.use multiple binary files to store the distribution instead of a single json file.(52 files for 52 lines)
